# treehouse-project-4-OOP-Game-Show-App
 My 4th treehouse project
For changing the styles in this project i did the background in the overlay to black.
and in the body i changed it to maroon. i did try to four different color in the background and found you could do 
a gradient backgound. but with the four colors it looked more like a rainbow then what i wanted.
this is the code to do this::
 //document.body.style.backgroundImage = 'linear-gradient(to right, maroon, green, blue, yellow)';
 so i just did a maroon background.
 i also changed the font in the banner of the boday. And also the color of font to black.
 to change the font i use the forn-family property. found html.am/html-codes/text/font-code.cfm.
